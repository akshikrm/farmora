The issue that I am referring to is the issue while reassigning to a different
batch and season while reassigning there needs to have a bit of calculation that
needs to be discussed, the problem is that if we reassign without quantity
change there is no need for updating the stock but if quantity is changed the
stock will be updated and how this will be updated needs to be confirmed.

Because if the reassign quantity is different what happens to the original qty
for example I have 30 items in batch A and reassign 20 to batch B then the
overall qty does not change but the assigned qty will change. There are a few
scenarios that needs to be documented and addressed before going further.

My idea is to have a separate dialog or page for reassigning(reassigning is only
for edit for new purchase there is no need for reassignment)
